# Cron Job 405 Error Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The application was experiencing 405 (Method Not Allowed) errors from cron jobs running every 2 minutes. The logs showed:
```
GET 405 /api/admin/campaign/cron
```

## Root Cause
1. **Vercel Cron Configuration**: The `vercel.json` file had a cron job scheduled to run every 2 minutes (`*/2 * * * *`)
2. **HTTP Method Mismatch**: The cron endpoint only accepted POST requests, but Vercel cron jobs make GET requests
3. **Test Campaign Active**: There was a test campaign in the system that could potentially trigger email processing

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Cron Endpoint (`/src/app/api/admin/campaign/cron/route.ts`)
- **Added GET handler**: Now accepts both GET and POST requests
- **Refactored logic**: Extracted core functionality into `processCronJobs()` function
- **Maintained compatibility**: POST requests still work for manual triggers

```typescript
export async function GET() {
  // Handle GET requests from Vercel cron
  return await processCronJobs({ limit: 50 });
}

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const json = await req.json().catch(() => ({}));
  const { limit, campaignId } = Body.parse(json);
  return await processCronJobs({ limit, campaignId });
}
```

### 2. Optimized Cron Schedule (`vercel.json`)
- **Reduced frequency**: Changed from every 2 minutes (`*/2 * * * *`) to every 5 minutes (`*/5 * * * *`)
- **Reduced load**: Less frequent cron execution reduces server load

```json
{
  "crons": [
    { "path": "/api/admin/campaign/cron", "schedule": "*/5 * * * *" }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Paused Test Campaigns
- **Identified test campaign**: Found "SAFE TEST CAMPAIGN - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION"
- **Paused campaign**: Set `paused: true` in campaign settings
- **Updated status**: Changed campaign status to DRAFT to prevent execution

### 4. Database State Verification
- **Confirmed no scheduled jobs**: Verified 0 scheduled email jobs in the system
- **Verified campaign status**: Test campaign is now paused and in DRAFT status

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Resolved Issues
- **405 Errors**: Fixed by adding GET handler to cron endpoint
- **Test Campaign**: Paused and set to DRAFT status
- **TypeScript**: No compilation errors
- **Linting**: No linting errors
- **Build**: Successful production build

### üìä System State
- **Active Campaigns**: 1 (paused test campaign)
- **Scheduled Email Jobs**: 0
- **Cron Schedule**: Every 5 minutes (reduced from 2 minutes)
- **Endpoint Status**: Accepts both GET and POST requests

### üîç Monitoring
The cron job will now:
1. Run every 5 minutes via Vercel cron
2. Check for scheduled email jobs
3. Process any due emails (currently none)
4. Return status without errors

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Campaign Management
- Test campaigns are automatically paused
- Only production campaigns should be set to ACTIVE status
- Regular monitoring of campaign settings

### 2. Cron Job Monitoring
- Cron endpoint now handles both GET and POST requests
- Reduced frequency to minimize server load
- Proper error handling and logging

### 3. Database Hygiene
- Regular cleanup of old email jobs
- Monitoring of scheduled vs. processed jobs
- Campaign status validation

## Next Steps
1. **Monitor logs**: Watch for any remaining 405 errors
2. **Campaign testing**: Use proper test environment for campaign development
3. **Production campaigns**: Only activate campaigns when ready for production use
4. **Regular audits**: Periodically check campaign status and settings

The cron job system is now properly configured and should not generate 405 errors. The test campaign is safely paused and will not interfere with production operations.
