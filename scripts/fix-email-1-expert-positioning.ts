    content: `Hi there,

I'm Gabriel Lacroix from Evergreen Web Solutions here in Terrace. I'm hosting a free informational session on October 23rd about practical AI tools for Northern BC businesses.

As someone who's been building AI solutions for years, I know how time-consuming routine tasks can be for local businesses. I've developed systems that automate data entry, inventory tracking, and customer follow-ups - and the results speak for themselves.

I'd like to share what I've learned at a free session on October 23rd at the Sunshine Inn. It's completely free, includes coffee and networking, and you'll learn about tools you can start using immediately.

The session will cover:
- Spreadsheet automation and data analysis
- Inventory and resource planning
- Customer communication streamlining
- Real tools that actually work (no hype)

I'm keeping it small and focused on practical solutions for businesses like yours in Northern BC.

RSVP here: {{rsvp_link}}

Hope to see you there,

I'm Gabriel Lacroix, and I run Evergreen Web Solutions here in Terrace. I'm guessing you're probably spending too much time on tasks that could be automated.

Are you manually updating spreadsheets, tracking inventory, or managing customer communications? I've been developing AI solutions for years, and I know exactly how these tools can transform your workflow.

What I've built and tested is pretty impressive - systems that handle routine tasks while you focus on growing your business. I've seen firsthand how AI can streamline operations without replacing people.

I'm sharing everything I've learned at a free session on October 23rd at the Sunshine Inn. No sales pitch, just practical tools and insights for Northern BC businesses.

You'll learn about:
- Automating repetitive data entry
- Predicting inventory needs
- Streamlining customer follow-ups
- Tools you can implement this week

Free coffee, networking, and actionable insights included.
